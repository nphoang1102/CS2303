### Actual WPI's course offered in C-term 2010 by Professor Hugh C. Lauer

Never had a chance to take this class, and it's already too late for me to take this class officially now, so I just searched for and downloaded whatever is available for me to self-study. Coded using gcc and Sublime Text 3 in Linux environment (my settings for Arch Linux are stored under the xfce-rice repo)
